# CRWN Clothing App

This project is an e-commerce app built with ReactJS, Firebase/Firestore, Redux and SCSS.
By building this project I learned how to use and setup Firebase authentications, manage databases in Firestore, setting up and managing states with Redux, and perfect the use of React-Router v6.
